# Adding Association Query Shortcuts

In this project, we're going to practice querying our tables more; in particular, we want to practice leveraging the foreign key columns we added to traverse **associations** between tables.

And, since we make these particular queries (the ones to find associated rows from other tables) so often, we're going to add instance methods that wrap up the logic and make it a snap to use.

## Setup

 1. In Codio, find the `photogram-queries` workspace.
 1. I have already done the üöÄ Initial project setup; no need to do it.
 1. üöÄ Start web server
 1. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Live app ‚Äî¬†You should see "Yay! You're on Rails" if all went well.

## The domain model

Here's the what the domain model looks like in this application, using [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams#discovery__top){:target="_blank"} notation:

![](/assets/photogram-queries-erd.png)

It's similar to the paper database we printed out on Day 1; if you have it, pull it out, because it will be very helpful to look at it while you are planning out how to write your queries.

I've already created these tables by running the following commands:

```bash
rails generate draft:model user username:string private:boolean likes_count:integer comments_count:integer
```

```bash
rails generate draft:model photo caption:text image:string owner_id:integer likes_count:integer comments_count:integer
```

```bash
rails generate draft:model follow_request sender_id:integer recipient_id:integer status:string
```

```bash
rails generate draft:model like fan_id:integer photo_id:integer
```

```bash
rails generate draft:model comment photo_id:integer body:text author_id:integer
```

I've already run `rails db:migrate` to execute these instructions, and also `rails dev:prime` to pre-populate them with some dummy data.

## Play around in rails console

Pop open a `rails console` and verify that the models got set up correctly:

```ruby
User.count
Photo.count
FollowRequest.count
Like.count
Comment.count
```

In your live app, you can visit the URL `http://[YOUR DOMAIN]/admin` (or click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è ActiveAdmin" in the menu) and check out the data being created via our quick-and-dirty dashboard (provided by the [ActiveAdmin gem](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin){:target="_blank"}).

## Resetting the database

If for some reason later you want to reset the database to square one, you need to first destroy it:

```bash
rails db:drop
```

and then re-create all of the tables:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

and then re-populate them:

```bash
rails dev:prime
```

However, that last step might take a while.

## reloading the console

Your goal, ultimately, will be to define instance methods that perform frequently-used queries. While you're trying to figure out how to do so, it will probably be helpful to bounce between the `rails console` (to experiment) and your model files (to define instance methods, which could potentially require many lines to ultimately `return` the correct thing). Remember that if you make any changes to a model file, you must `reload!` in the `rails console` _and_ recreate any variables you were using before the new logic will be available.

## Queries to write

### Appetizers

Here are some `rails console` appetizer queries to try. For the user `"Trina"`,

  - How many photos has the user posted?
  - How many photos has the user liked?
  - How many comments has the user made?
     - How many photos has the user commented on? Is this the same as the number of comments the user has made? Hint: there's a method called `.distinct` that you can call on a collection to remove duplicates.
  - How many follow requests has the user sent?
     - How many of those were accepted? (I.e. how many people is the user following?)
  - How many follow requests has the user received?
     - How many of those were accepted? (I.e. how many followers does the user have?)
  - What are the usernames of all of the people the user is following?
  - How many photos are in the user's feed (photos posted by the people the user is following)?
  - How many photos have the people the user is following liked?

### Your tasks

Ultimately, define the following instance methods to encapsulate the logic you discovered in the appetizer queries:

**Note:** In the Ruby community, a shorthand for saying "an instance method[^class_method_shorthand] called `zebra` on `Photo`" is "`Photo#zebra`". (Unfortunately this is yet _another_ thing that the octothorpe symbol is (over)used for.)

[^class_method_shorthand]: The analogous shorthand for class methods uses a `.` instead of the `#`: "a **class** method on `Photo` called `zebra`" is abbreviated "`Photo.zebra`".

 - `Photo#poster` should return the user who posted the photo.
 - `Photo#comments` should return the comments made on the photo.
 - `Comment#commenter` should return the user who authored the comment.
 - `Photo#likes` should return the likes made on the photo.
 - `Photo#fans` should return the users that have liked the photo.
 - `Photo#fan_list` should return the usernames of the users that have liked the photo as a sentence.

    Hint: Rails adds a handy method to `Array`s of strings called  `.to_sentence`:

    https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Array.html#method-i-to_sentence
 - `User#comments` should return the comments the user has made.
 - `User#own_photos` should return the photos posted by the user.
 - `User#likes` should return the likes created by the user.
 - `User#liked_photos` should return the photos the user has liked.
 - `User#commented_photos` should return the photos the user has commented on.
 - `User#sent_follow_requests` should return all of the follow requests that were sent by the user.
 - `User#received_follow_requests` should return all of the follow requests that were received by the user.
 - `User#accepted_sent_follow_requests` should return the follow requests that were sent by the user and accepted.
 - `User#accepted_received_follow_requests` should return the follow requests that were received by the user and accepted.
 - `User#followers` should return the people whose follow requests the user has accepted.
 - `User#following` should return the people that have accepted the user's follow requests.
 - `User#feed` should return the photos posted by the people the user is following.
 - `User#discover` should return the photos that are liked by the people the user is following.
